		q: 'You don’t work at Monogram to remove roadblocks, you work here to pave new paths. You don’t just solve problems, you join a family of designers & developers who collaborate like clockwork, rise together, fall together, and do their life’s work here. A front-end developer at Monogram is someone that is motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming. An ideal front-end developer is a designer first, but a HTML and CSS wizard 🧙🏻 at the same time.',
		a: "Well, first and foremost I like to create beautiful things. It's all in the eye of the beholder of course, but harmony and proportions go a long way towards universality. So UI first, but UX is also beauty - simplicity and ease of use are paramount. If my grandmother can use it without asking for help, job's a good 'un."

	{
		q: 'Collaborate on a daily basis with a team of product managers, engineers, and UI/UX designers to understand business requirements, user experience goals and pain points',
		a: 'Sounds like a plan. We’re building things for users after all.'
	},
	{
		q: '🔥 Meticulously translate the UI/UX design wireframes to actual code mobile first',
		a: 'Since man started to sculpt, paint, create anything, harmony of proportions have been understood to be important. Sometimes half a pixel makes all the difference.'
	},
	{ q: 'Develop new user-facing features', a: 'User, user, user.' },
	{
		q: 'Build reusable components and libraries for future use',
		a: 'Why redo from the ground up something that has been done successfully before? (operating word: successfully 😉)'
	},
	{
		q: 'Optimize application for maximum speed and scalability',
		a: 'Did I mention user? Also: impressive  💡🏠 scores on the Vercel case study.'
	},
	{
		q: 'Ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs',

	{
		q: 'Solid understanding of CSS (including preprocessors like SASS)',
		a: 'To use a JS framework, you need to understand JS. To use a CSS framework, you need to understand CSS. Although I must confess a non-solid knowledge of preprocessors.'
	},
	{
		q: 'Tailwind CSS',
		a: 'Together with Svelte, a beautiful combination (with a couple of pain points like conditional classes or to reactively generate a class). I even made a webapp to generate color ranges across the whole hue spectrum.'
	},
	{
		q: 'Svelte/SvelteKit',
		a: 'I have been a convert since the Sapper days and Rich Harris’ "Rethinking Reactivity" conference. Now you have to drag me kicking and screaming to use another JS framework. Concise, elegant, readable. Only issue it that debugging compiled code is not always straightforward.'

	},
	{
		q: 'TypeScript',
		a: 'I used to prefer the less boilerplatey JS, now I’m a full convert. It forces a more thoughtful approach when coding, makes sharing easier, prevents many avoidable runtime bugs, and makes one progress in their understanding of JS. A time-saver in the end.'
	},
	{
		q: 'Knowledge of JAMstack',
		a: 'Getting there: fast, leightweigth, reduced TTI - all things to strive for. I’d say I’m mostly lacking in the CDN part of things.'
